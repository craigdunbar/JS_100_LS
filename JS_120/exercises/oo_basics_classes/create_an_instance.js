// Using the code from the previous exercise, create an instance of Catand assign 
// it to a variable named kitty.

class Cat {

}

let kitty = new Cat();

// To instantiate a new `Cat` object, we use the keyword `new` in front 
// of the function call. This keyword turns the function call 
// into a constructor call.

To make use of this new `Cat` object, we need to assign 
it to a variable. 
In the solution, we assign the object to a variable named `kitty`.
