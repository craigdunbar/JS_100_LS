/*
Question 1
Given a string return a new string that replaces every
occurence of the word 'important' with 'urgent':

let advice = "Few things in life are as important as house training your pet dinosaur.";
console.log(advice.replace('important', 'urgent'));

Further exploration:
Remove multiple occurrences of the same word
advice = advice.replace(/important/g, 'urgent');
advice = advice.replaceAll('important', 'urgent'); // doesn't work?
console.log(advice);

Question 2
