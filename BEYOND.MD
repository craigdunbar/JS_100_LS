How to spot edge cases and ask the right questions

Bad input: is there bad input that my function should guard against? For example, if the problem only talks about positive integers as input, should I guard against negative integers? What should my function return if a negative integer is passed in as an argument?
Empty input: if my function accepts strings, arrays or objects, what should it return if they're empty?
You make no assumptions: just because all examples the interviewer provides are happy paths doesn't mean your function should only handle happy paths. If you notice a pattern but aren’t sure it'll always be true or hold up, don't assume —ask.
Order of input: if my function expects more than one argument, what should it return if they're passed in in the wrong order?
No input: should I always expect an argument to be passed in? What should my function return if no argument is passed in?
Data type of input: should my function only expect one data type to be passed in as argument? What should it return if a different data type is passed in?
